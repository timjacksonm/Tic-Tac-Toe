## Goals:
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Create gameBoard , displayController and players. Use what I have learned using factories and modules to organize code.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Try to tuck everything away and have as little global code as possible.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Set up your HTML and write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameBoard array to the web page.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, then tie it to the DOM.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player!

**Optional Extra Credit**

- [‚úîÔ∏è] Learn about responsive design and make game playable across multiple devices!
- [‚úîÔ∏è] learn and apply how to add transition effects.
- [‚úîÔ∏è] create an AI so that a player can play against the computer!
- [ ] Once AI is working, make it unbeatable!
- [ ] ~~add a light/dark mode button to the site.~~ I decided not to do extra credit here. As it doesn't make sense for a tic-tac-toe game. Will try on the next project!

## Summary

This project was a lot of fun. It focused on modules and factories. No more writing code however I like. This took planning and a thought out process. As a personal goal I tried my best to learn responsive web design and incorporate the design in my project. I did add a few unique transitions to the game. The winning transitions are disabled if you are using a smaller screen "mobile friendly". Currently you can play 1 player (you vs computer) or 2 player. You can decide which players turn starts the game!
