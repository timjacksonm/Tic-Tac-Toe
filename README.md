# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Goals:
- [✔️] Create gameBoard , displayController and players. Use what I have learned using factories and modules to organize code.
- [✔️] Try to tuck everything away and have as little global code as possible.
- [✔️] Set up your HTML and write a javaScript funciton that will render the contents of the gameBoard array to the webpage.
- [✔️] Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, then tie it to the DOM.
- [✔️] Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie.
- [✔️] Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player!

**Optional Extra Credit**

- [✔️] learn and apply how to add transition effects.
- [✔️] create an AI so that a player can play against the computer!
- [] Once AI is working, make it unbeatable!
- [x] ~~add a light/dark mode button to the site.~~ I decided not to do this option as it doesn't make sense for a tic-tac-toe game. Will try on the next project!
